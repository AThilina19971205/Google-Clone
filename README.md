# Google Design Clone

The Google Design Clone project is a static website built with HTML and CSS. It closely resembles the look and feel of the Google search page, including the logo, search bar, buttons, and overall styling.

Please note that this clone project is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It does not include any real search functionality or backend integration with the Google search engine.

This is done by me to practice html,css
